## Feature: Basic Asset Loading System Implemented

**Description:**
The core asset loading system has been implemented, focusing on textures. This includes defining generic asset loading mechanisms, a caching system, and integrating texture loading directly into the rendering pipeline.

**Details of Implementation:**
- Defined `AssetLoader` trait and `AssetCache` for generic asset management.
- Implemented `TextureLoader` to load image files into `wgpu::Texture` objects.
- Integrated the new asset loading and caching into the `RenderEngine`, replacing hardcoded texture loading.
- Updated `winit` and `wgpu` API usage to resolve compilation errors and ensure compatibility.
- Added vertex and index buffers for basic rendering of a textured primitive.

**Remaining Work:**
- Implementing other asset types (Mesh, Material, Shader) and their loaders.
- Integrating mesh loading into the rendering pipeline.
- Developing a scene graph and object management system.
- Adding basic lighting.
- Improving error handling and logging.
- Refactoring `RenderEngine` for better modularity.
- General cleanup and optimization.
