# Protocol Implementation Analysis

This document outlines the discrepancies found by comparing the `slv-rust` client's login sequence against the official Second Life viewer's logs (`officiallog.txt`) and the documented login flow (`official_flow.md`).

## Key Findings

The analysis reveals that the `slv-rust` client's login process is failing due to an incomplete implementation of the handshake sequence and a bug in the packet decoder.

### 1. Incomplete Handshake Sequence (Critical Error)

The most critical issue is the client's failure to send all required packets after the `RegionHandshakeReply`. This breaks the login flow and prevents the server from proceeding.

- **`slv-rust` Behavior**: After sending `RegionHandshakeReply`, the client sends `AgentThrottle` and then stops, failing to complete the handshake.
- **Official Viewer Behavior**: After `RegionHandshakeReply`, the official viewer sends a sequence of three essential packets:
    1.  `AgentThrottle`
    2.  `AgentHeightWidth`
    3.  `AgentUpdate`

**Conclusion**: The `slv-rust` implementation is missing the `AgentHeightWidth` and, most importantly, the `AgentUpdate` packets. According to `official_flow.md`, the `AgentUpdate` packet is what "really gets things going." Without it, the server will not send the avatar's position or object updates, causing the login to stall indefinitely.

### 2. Unhandled Incoming Packet (Decoder Bug)

The `slv-rust` client is encountering and failing to parse a valid packet from the server.

- **`slv-rust` Log**:
  ```
  WARN ... slv_rust::networking::protocol::sl_compatibility: src/networking/protocol/sl_compatibility.rs:371: [SL_CODEC] ‚ùå Unsupported or unknown message type
  ```
  This error occurs for an incoming packet with `seq=7` and type `[FF, FF, 01, 42]`.

- **Official Viewer Log**: The official log shows the viewer successfully receiving and processing various packets that `slv-rust` does not appear to handle, such as `OnlineNotification`, `ViewerEffect`, and `CoarseLocationUpdate`.

**Conclusion**: The packet decoder in `slv-rust` is incomplete. This is a bug that prevents the client from handling all valid server communications, which can lead to instability and unexpected behavior even if the main handshake were correct.

### 3. `UuidNameRequest` is Not an Error

- My initial analysis noted that `slv-rust` was missing the `UuidNameRequest` packet mentioned in `official_flow.md`.
- However, the `officiallog.txt` from the official viewer **also** lacks a `UuidNameRequest` packet.

**Conclusion**: This confirms that `UuidNameRequest` is not a required part of the modern login flow. Its absence in `slv-rust` is not an error, and `official_flow.md` is likely outdated in this specific regard.

## Summary of Required Fixes

To resolve the login failure, the following issues must be addressed in the `slv-rust` client:

1.  **Implement `AgentHeightWidth` and `AgentUpdate`**: The client **must** send these two packets immediately after `AgentThrottle` to complete the handshake correctly.
2.  **Fix the Packet Decoder**: The decoder must be updated to handle the unknown message type (`[FF, FF, 01, 42]`) and other packets sent by the server during login to ensure robust communication.
