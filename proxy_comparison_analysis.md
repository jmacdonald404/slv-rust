# Proxy Implementation Analysis

## Issue Summary
The **networking branch** only sends one SOCKS5 packet and then the connection drops after ~15 seconds, while **main branch** successfully sends many packets continuously.

## Root Cause Analysis

### From log.txt analysis:
1. **Line 268-269**: First SOCKS5 packet sent successfully
2. **Line 297**: SOCKS5 client dropped after 15 seconds (`üóëÔ∏è Dropping SOCKS5 client`)
3. **Missing**: No subsequent packet sends or connection recovery

### Key Differences:

**Main Branch (Working)**:
- Simple `Socks5UdpSocket` with direct UDP socket access
- No complex mutex contention 
- Direct SOCKS5 implementation without timeout issues
- Socket stays alive for multiple packets

**Networking Branch (Failing)**:
- Complex `Socks5UdpClient` with `Arc<Mutex<Option<UdpSocket>>>`
- Connection drops after first use
- No connection recovery mechanism
- Overly complex architecture causing connection instability

## Specific Problems in Networking Branch:

1. **Connection Lifecycle**: The SOCKS5 client is being dropped, likely due to:
   - TCP keep-alive not working properly
   - UDP socket being released prematurely
   - Connection timeout from proxy side

2. **Architecture Complexity**: The networking branch over-engineers the solution with:
   - Multiple Arc/Mutex layers
   - Timeout mechanisms that cause contention
   - Connection pooling that isn't needed

3. **Missing Reconnection**: When the SOCKS5 client drops, there's no recovery

## Recommended Fix

**Option 1: Port Main Branch Logic**
Copy the simple, working SOCKS5 implementation from main branch to networking branch.

**Option 2: Fix Connection Dropout**  
- Investigate why TCP control connection is being lost
- Add proper connection recovery logic
- Simplify the mutex architecture

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
Keep networking branch architecture but replace SOCKS5 client with main branch implementation.

## Test Strategy

1. Run both branches with identical proxy setup
2. Count successful packet sends over 60 seconds
3. Monitor connection lifecycle events
4. Compare proxy packet logs between branches

Expected Result: Main branch should show ~10-20 packets, networking branch shows 1 packet then connection drop.
