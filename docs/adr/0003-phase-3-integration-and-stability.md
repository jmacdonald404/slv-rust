# ADR-0003: Phase 3 - Integration and Stability

**Date**: 2025-07-30

**Status**: Accepted

## Context

The project has successfully completed its initial development phases, resulting in a well-defined architecture and foundational implementations for core systems, including networking, rendering, and asset management. These systems have been built according to the principles outlined in `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `perf.md`.

The project is now at a critical inflection point. While the individual components are architecturally sound, they are not yet integrated into a functioning application. The next logical step, as outlined in the `README.md` roadmap, is to focus on stability and integration to create a testable, baseline version of the viewer.

## Decision

We will formally enter **Phase 3: Integration and Stability**. The primary goal of this phase is to transform the collection of individual systems into a single, cohesive application that can successfully connect to the SecondLife grid and serve as a stable foundation for future feature development.

The key deliverables for this phase are:

1.  **End-to-End Connection Lifecycle**: Implement the full, uninterrupted sequence from user action to world connection:
    *   User initiates login via the UI.
    *   The application performs XML-RPC authentication.
    *   It receives a simulator address and establishes a UDP circuit.
    *   A successful connection is confirmed, and the application is ready to receive world data.
    *   A clean logout and teardown process is implemented.

2.  **Core UI Implementation**: Develop the minimum UI required to support the connection lifecycle and provide basic feedback. This includes:
    *   Login screen with username/password fields.
    *   Status indicators for connection state (e.g., "Connecting," "Connected," "Failed").
    *   A simple "Disconnect" button.

3.  **Initial World Data Rendering**: Connect the networking layer's output to the rendering engine. When the networking layer dispatches an `ObjectUpdate` event (or similar), the rendering engine must be able to process it and draw a basic representation of that object in the 3D scene.

4.  **Build and Configuration Hardening**:
    *   Eliminate all compiler warnings and `clippy` lints to ensure code quality.
    *   Define and document distinct `debug` and `release` build profiles with appropriate flags for optimization and debugging symbols.

5.  **Establish Baseline Testing**:
    *   Create an end-to-end integration test that validates the entire login and circuit connection process.
    *   Ensure all existing and new unit tests pass (`cargo test`).

## Rationale

This phase prioritizes de-risking the project by proving that the core architectural components can work together effectively. By focusing on a stable, end-to-end vertical slice of functionality, we can identify and resolve fundamental integration issues early. Attempting to build more advanced features (e.g., full inventory, complex chat UI) before this baseline is established would be inefficient and likely lead to significant rework.

Achieving the goals of Phase 3 will provide a stable, testable foundation, making subsequent feature development in Phase 4 faster, easier, and more predictable.

## Consequences

### Positive

-   Creates a stable, verifiable application milestone ("it connects and runs").
-   Uncovers fundamental integration bugs before more complexity is added.
-   Provides a solid foundation for parallelizing future feature development.
-   Boosts project momentum with a clear, tangible success.

### Negative

-   This phase deliberately postpones work on more user-visible features, such as advanced graphics or a comprehensive UI.
